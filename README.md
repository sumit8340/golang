# Golang Application

This is a simple Golang application that serves a webpage with a blue background and the text "It is working!" displayed. You can run this application on your local machine without using Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your machine:

- Go (version 1.17 or higher)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the application manually on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. Build the application:

   ```
   go build
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```
   ./<executable-name>
   ```

5. The application should now be running. Open a web browser and visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see a blue page with the text "It is working!" displayed.

6. To stop the application, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the application is running.

## Customization

If you want to customize the application, you can modify the `main.go` file. You can change the background color, text color, or the content of the webpage to suit your needs. After making the changes, follow the "Getting Started" steps again to rebuild and run the application.
